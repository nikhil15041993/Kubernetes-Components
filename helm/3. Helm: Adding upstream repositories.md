We have apt,yum,dnf package manager in Linux distros, similarly Helm relies on bitnami chart repositories and Chart Developer can create YAML configuration file and package them into charts and publish it as chart repositories.

For Example - You want to deploy Redis in-memory cache inside your kubernetes cluster from Helm repository, so you can simply run the following command -
```
helm install redis bitnami/redis
```

### ADD upstream Helm chart repository
There are five repo commands provided by Helm which can be used for add,list,remove,update,index the chart repository.
```
add : Add chart repository
list : List chart repository
update : Update the chart information locally
index : For generating the index file
remove : Remove chart repository
```

To add any chart repository you should know the name and repository url.
```
helm repo add <REPOSITORY_NAME> <REPOSITORY_URL>
```

### Here is the final command
```
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
```


### Verify the repository
```
helm search repo bitnami
```
It should return you back with all the charts which are available inside bitnami repository
```

### 'list' Helm Chart repository
In the previous step we have added the bitnami repository, lets run the list command for listing the repositories we have added so far.
```
helm repo list
```
It should return you back with
```
NAME   	URL                               
bitnami	https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
```

### update' Helm Chart repository
In the previous two steps we have seen - How to add and list the Helm Repositories.

Lets see how you can update your helm repositories. (The update command is necessary if haven't updated your Helm chart repository in a while, so might miss some recent changes)

Here is the command to update Helm repository
```
helm repo update
```
Once your update has completed you should see following message on your console

```
Hang tight while we grab the latest from your chart repositories...
...Successfully got an update from the "bitnami" chart repository
Update Complete. ⎈Happy Helming!⎈
```

### 'remove' Helm Chart repository
If in case you want to remove certain repositories then Helm provides remove command which can be used for removing the repositories.

In the previous steps we have added bitnami repositories, so now we are going to remove the same repositories using the remove command
```
helm repo remove bitnami
```
After the successful removal you should see the following message
```
"bitnami" has been removed from your repositories 
```
